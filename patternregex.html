<div class="patternregex">
  <h2>Regex with the Pattern tag</h2>
  <form action="" method="get">
  Regex client side with no JS: <input type="text" pattern="[A-Za-z]{3}" title="Three letter or numbers">
  <input type="submit">
</form>
<p>This doesn't access any hardware, but I included this as using local storage might mean inputs and validation is nice.
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The pattern attribute of the input tag is not supported in Internet Explorer 9 and earlier versions, or in Safari.</p>
